Overview: 

SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

    - Ensure that each class has one responsibility 
      and only does the task that it has been designed for
    - Code will be easier to understand and maintain if followed
	
OCP: Open Closed Principle

    - Open for extension but closed for modification
      (New behavior can be added but do NOT modify existing code)
	  
LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle

    - If you replace an object with instances of its subtype the program
      should still function correctly.
	  
ISP: Interface Segregation Principle

    - Keep it skinny! 
    - All classes that use an interface should not have any unused methods
	
DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle

    - A specific class shoudl not depend on another class but rather 
      an abstract class/interface of specified class
